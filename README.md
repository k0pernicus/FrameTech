# FrameTech

An example of a game and the custom `FrameTech` engine.

This repository includes:

1. a simple application (game),
2. a custom standard library for FrameTech, called `ftstd`,
3. a custom engine called `FrameTech`.

The custom standard library, `ftstd` (for "FrameTech STanDard library"), is enough to run and debug the engine only,
and has no purpose to run in PRODUCTION mode for the moment.

This engine is divided in several namespaces, or parts, like `Graphics`.
